<h2> Other Playing Padel Tennis FAQs</h2> 
<h3> What is Padel? </h3>
<p>Padel Tennis is a sport similar to tennis and squash, played on a smaller court. Unlike Tennis, the ball can bounce off the walled court and the scoring system is the same as tennis. It is most commonly played in doubles and the ball is similar to a tennis ball. It has been one of the widest growing sports in recent times. </p>
<h3> How to Play Padel? </h3>
<p>It is easy to get started playing Padel Tennis. Book a court with friends or join a coached session. </p>

<h3> Is Padel the same as pickleball? </h3>
<p>No, they are different sports. While Padel is played on a walled court, pickleball courts have no walls. A pickleball is smaller and the sport has a no volley zone rule at the front of the court, which Padel Tennis doesn’t adhere to. </p>

<h3> Can you play Padel singles? </h3>
<p>Yes, technically you can play Padel Tennis singles. However, because of the court size we suggest that it is a game better suited to doubles. </p>

<h3> How big is a Padel court? </h3>
<p>A standard Padel Tennis court is 10M by 20M, but courts can vary slightly. This makes it slightly shorter and slightly wider than a tennis court. </p>

</h3> How much does it cost to build a Padel court? </h3>
<p>In the UK, it costs from £50,000 to £80,000 to build a Padel court. The high manufacturing cost is one factor for the lack of Padel Tennis courts in London. </p>
